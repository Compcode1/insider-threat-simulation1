    "**Scenario Narrative: Compromised Privileged Account in a Small Organization**\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting is a small, resource-constrained organization with minimal endpoint security segmentation. The IT administrator, Steve, manages the host and has full administrative access. Due to weak internal security controls and credential reuse, the Steve account has been silently compromised—either through phishing, a leaked password, or an earlier escalation by a malicious insider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker now operates directly from this privileged context. Without the need to bypass traditional access controls, they begin making subtle but meaningful changes to the system. Their goal is to persist on the host, explore its network environment, and operate quietly without triggering immediate alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation models the behavior of that attacker by executing a series of host-based actions. The activity is intentionally designed to generate a clear and structured audit trail. Key attacker behaviors—such as failed logon attempts, obfuscated PowerShell execution, scheduled task creation, and simulated lateral movement—will be captured and analyzed.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Logon Activity Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for:\n",
    "A cluster of failed logons (Event ID 4625) followed shortly by a successful logon (Event ID 4624) for the same account (Steve).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",

    "What to look for:\n",
    "A PowerShell process (Event ID 4688) launching calc.exe via the iex (Invoke-Expression) command.\n",
    "Script block logging (if enabled) should show the full obfuscated payload.\n",
    "\n",

    "This sharply focuses your detection window and removes unrelated logon noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes\n",
    "Why not just see one 4624 after the 4625s? Because Windows logs multiple service-related logons immediately after a user logs in. This is normal, and analysts must learn to distinguish true user access from system-level background sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This complexity is part of why logon telemetry is both powerful and noisy — the same Event IDs can mean very different things depending on account type, logon type, and timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supplement: Understanding DESKTOP-XXXXX$ Logon Entries**\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing logon patterns in Windows Event Logs (especially Event ID 4624 for successful logons), you’ll often see accounts like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Account Name: DESKTOP-UPKRV33$\n",
    "These entries refer to the computer account itself, not a human user. This can be confusing during triage, but here’s what’s actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Is a Computer Account?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, every machine that is part of a domain — or even standalone systems — has its own internal security context, represented as the machine name followed by a dollar sign ($). Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "DESKTOP-UPKRV33$\n",
    "\n",
    "This account is used automatically by Windows to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticate internal services\n",
    "\n",
    "Start system processes under trusted context\n",
    "\n",
    "Interact with local or domain resources (e.g., file shares, policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do You See These During a User Login?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a human user (e.g., Steve) logs in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows doesn’t just authenticate Steve\n",
    "\n",
    "It also performs machine-level logons behind the scenes, using DESKTOP-UPKRV33$, to initialize background services and trusted subsystems\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially common when:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user has local administrator rights (like in this simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system starts services, loads profiles, or runs scheduled tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Should You Investigate These?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases: No.\n",
    "These are considered benign system noise unless:\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine account is interacting with external resources abnormally\n",
    "\n",
    "There are unexpected logon types (e.g., Type 3 over the network, or Type 10 from RDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The activity is happening independent of user logon times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice for Analysts**\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing user-focused triage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter out or deprioritize machine account logons ($) unless they match suspicious patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus first on interactive user accounts and their corresponding Event IDs (4624, 4625, 4648, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction helps reduce false leads and lets you zero in on attacker-driven behavior.\n",

    "Telemetry Validation Is Non-Trivial: Significant time was spent enabling and validating audit policies, user permissions, and Splunk configuration to ensure full log visibility. These challenges reflect real-world deployment and monitoring issues.\n",
